# VUIM

### Vi Un-IMproved

The ultimate piece of garbage code.



#### Features:

##### 	Figure them out yourself.

##### 	User bloat protection.

â€‹		With no way to save files, VUIM protects the user from bloating their system; as anything you cannot commit to memory is probably useless bloatware. For example: VIM, this program is so bloated that it would be near impossible for any user to remember its entire source code. However, VUIM is so efficient and lightweight that the user can easily recall all its 127 lines of code.



#### 100% truly intended features:

- terminal text is messed up after use



#### Installation:

`git clone https://github.com/Genghius/vuim`

`cd vuim`

`make install`
