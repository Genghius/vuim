# VUIM—Vi Un-IMproved

The ultimate piece of garbage code.

## Features

Figure them out yourself.

## User bloat protection.

With no way to save files, VUIM protects the user from bloating their
system; as anything you cannot commit to memory is probably useless
bloatware.  For example: Vim, this program is so bloated that it would
be near impossible for any user to remember its entire source code.
However, VUIM is so efficient and lightweight that the user can easily
recall all its 126 lines of code.

## More Intended Features

- terminal text is messed up after use

## Installation:

VUIM should run on any system conforming to the Single UNIX
Specification.

	make install
